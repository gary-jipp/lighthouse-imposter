## What is Imposter Syndrome?
The idea that you’ve only succeeded due to luck, and not because of your talent or qualification.  This includes doubting your abilities and feeling like a fraud.

"Maybe I'm in the wrong business.  I'm not cut out for this"!


## When does Imposter Syndrome occur?
Once you learn more, you realize there is so much more to learn. This seems to accelerate as you learn more and more and discover the world is so much bigger than you thought.  Just when you thought you "got it" you're faced with something that seems beyond your ability

#### Bootcamp -> React is often a point where this happens.

## Your journey
Whenever you are doubtful of your skill or abilities. Remember how far you have come across. Be proud of your progress, however little it may be.

## 5 hats of Imposter Syndrome

* ask for help (some companies are so busy, they just can't)
* Keep Improving - continue to practice skills
* know what you don’t know


## Continue to Code & Upskill

## Pick what you want to be good at
 - Stick with the core technologies you know
 - JavaScript (jQuery, React,etc)  html, css
 - stick to the 'C' family for now. JavaScript, Java, C++, etc

## Senior Dev vs Junior Dev
- It's not so much about Skill, more about Experience!
- Have seen more things go wrong (often have caused it!)
- They "will" solve the problem, no matter what
- Have experience in searching for new information
- Don't need as much direction
- wider range of technologies, larger base to draw from
- Personal Stories:  Destroy production data, lost weeks of code
- All Senior Devs have stories like this.  Some are really scary!

## Don't Forget Where you Started
One day, not so long ago, you were just starting. A beginner, that wouldn't be able to pick out an integer from a float. Now you've written full-stack applications, have worked in a team using Git, have not only talked the talk but are walking the walk.

When your fingers are at a keyboard, magic happens. An empty folder is quickly populated with a city of files filled with business of data, and citizens of functions. From nothing: something!

This should not be taken lightly. Don't just look, but feel where you are now compared to that humble beginning. Say it aloud:

> I can write programs. I know multiple programming languages. I can read documentation. I can build a web application, and already have!

Like one of your favourite booleans, that statement is `true`.

Spend real time looking back to admire your progress, reflect on the present and what needs to be done, and keep an eye to what is yet to come!

## Where You're Going
Seniors Devs don't know everything. They often just know how to get to an answer faster. They've learned how to learn, how to parse documentation and take the important bits quickly. If you do something everyday, sure you'll memorize the commands you use all the time, but more important than that in this forever shifting landscape is your ability to adapt.

Be willing to try, have something not work, and to try again. Experiment. `git commit`, break things, and roll back. Try things! Keep trying things until it works. Persistance and tenacity are the key.

## Be Proud
* You've come a long way.
* You've grown, and learned, a lot!
* You **are** a developer! No question.
    * You HAVE written code that works.
    * You've built a project with a team.
    * You've built a web application.
    * You **ARE** a developer! Say it aloud, and let it sink in.

## Network

* Volunteer for local, national, and online groups.
    * Volunteer as a mentor, or teacher.
    * Volunteer to do a talk on a tech or programming topic.
* Attend events (since COVID started, many are available online now too!)
    * Experience new and exciting topics curated by industry leaders.
    * Socialize after any talk or event to meet new developers and potential employers.
* Join web developer Slack groups (check your town, your province, and for national groups.)
    * Here you'll meet people!
    * Ask for help.
    * Offer help!
    * Advertise your talks!
    * Hear all sorts of perspectives from different developers.
